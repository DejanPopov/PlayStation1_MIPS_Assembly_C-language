### CPU Registers

- The PlayStation CPU has **32 general-purpose registers**, ranging from R0 to R31.
- When programming in assembly, these registers are referred to by **special nicknames** (mnemonics) rather than their R-numbers.
    - Examples of these nicknames include `$0` (for R0), `$at` (for R1), `$v0`, `$v1`, `$a0`, `$a1`, `$t0`, `$t1`, `$s0`, `$s1`, `$k0`, `$k1`, `$gp`, and `$sp`.
- Initially, for learning and writing first lines of assembly code, the source suggests primarily using the **`$t` registers (temporary registers)**, such as `$t0`, `$t1`, etc.. These are chosen because they are versatile for adding, saving, and loading values.
- While all 32 registers are technically "general purpose" and can be used as desired, these nicknames often imply **special purposes or responsibilities** by convention (e.g., `$v` registers for return values, `$a` registers for arguments). The specific roles of different register categories (A, T, S, K, SP) will be explained later in the course.

### Assembly Instructions: General

- Assembly code is a human-readable way to represent CPU instructions.
- All instructions in MIPS assembly are **fixed 32 bits long**.
- Common CPU instructions include loading values into registers, loading/storing values into memory, arithmetic operations (add, subtract), and comparisons.

### Load Instructions: Specific Types

1. **`li` (load immediate)**
    
    - **Purpose**: Loads a **constant or immediate value** (a direct number) into a general-purpose register.
    - **Syntax Example**: `li $t0, 10` (loads the decimal value 10 into register `$t0`).
    - **Value Representation**: The constant can be expressed in **decimal or hexadecimal** notation.
    - **Size**: A register can store **32 bits (4 bytes)**, so `li` can load multi-byte constants.
2. **`la` (load address)**
    
    - **Purpose**: Loads the **memory address** of a label or a global variable into a register.
    - **Syntax Example**: `la $t2, label` (loads the address of `label` into register `$t2`).
    - **Labels**: Labels in assembly code are **aliases or nicknames for memory addresses**, which can point to code or data (like a global variable).
3. **`lb` (load byte)**
    
    - **Purpose**: Loads **one byte** of data from a specified memory address into a register.
    - **Address Calculation**: The memory address is determined by adding a **base address** to an **offset**. The offset is often a value contained within another register.
    - **Syntax Example**: `lb $t3, 0x8000($t0)` (loads one byte from the address `0x8000` plus the value in `$t0` into register `$t3`).
    - **Destination**: The register on the left-hand side receives the _contents_ of the specified memory address.
4. **`lbu` (load byte unsigned)**
    
    - **Purpose**: Similar to `lb`, but treats the loaded byte as an **unsigned value**, meaning it will always be positive and not interpreted as negative.
5. **`lui` (load upper immediate)**
    
    - **Purpose**: Loads a 16-bit immediate value into the **upper (most significant) 16 bits** of a 32-bit register. The **lower 16 bits are filled with zeros**.
    - **Syntax Example**: `lui $t4, 0x8001` (loads `0x8001` into the upper 16 bits of `$t4`, making `$t4` contain `0x80010000`).
    - **Use Case**: Useful for setting the upper 16 bits of a register when constructing larger 32-bit addresses or values.

### Data Types and Sizes (MIPS/PS1 Context)

Understanding data sizes is crucial because load instructions (and future store instructions) specify the amount of data to move.

- **`byte`**:
    
    - **Size**: **1 byte (8 bits)**.
    - **C Equivalent**: `char` or `car`.
    - **Load Instructions**: `lb` (signed), `lbu` (unsigned).
- **`half` (half-word)**:
    
    - **Size**: **2 bytes (16 bits)**.
    - **C Equivalent**: `short`.
    - **Load Instructions**: `lh` (signed), `lhu` (unsigned).
- **`word`**:
    
    - **Size**: **4 bytes (32 bits)**.
    - This is the **size of a register** in the PS1's 32-bit MIPS architecture.
    - **C Equivalent**: `int` or `long` (for PS1 hardware, both are 4 bytes).
    - **Load Instructions**: `lw` (signed), `lwu` (unsigned).
- **`double word` (d-word)**:
    
    - **Size**: **8 bytes (64 bits)**.
    - **C Equivalent**: `long long`.
    - **PS1 Specific**: The **PS1's 32-bit MIPS processor does not have an `ld` (load double word) instruction**, unlike more advanced 64-bit MIPS processors (e.g., R4000). Therefore, programmers only need to consider `byte`, `half`, and `word` sizes for loads on the PS1.
