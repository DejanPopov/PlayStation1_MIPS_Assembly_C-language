*   **CPU Overview**
    *   The PlayStation uses a **32-bit RISC CPU** with a **MIPS instruction set**.
    *   This marks a shift in home consoles to **RISC-based processors**, moving away from older CISC architectures.
    *   It is an **R300A MIPS CPU**.
    *   The CPU is considered a **"system on a chip"** because it includes co-processors and other internal components that aid the main CPU, all within the same chip die.

*   **Manufacturer and Supplier**
    *   While the architecture is MIPS, **LSI Logic** was the actual supplier of the CPU.
    *   Sony chose LSI Logic for their business solution that offered a CPU compatible with the MIPS R3000 instruction set.
    *   **Jensen Huang**, the current Nvidia CEO, was a director at LSI Logic between 1985 and 1993, just before the PSX release.

*   **Technical Specifications**
    *   **Architecture**: **32-bit RISC architecture**.
    *   **Clock Frequency**: **33.87 MHz**.
    *   **Registers**:
        *   Features **32 general-purpose registers**, which is significantly more than older consoles like the NES or Atari 2600 (which had only 3).
        *   Includes **two dedicated multiplication and division registers**.
    *   **Buses**:
        *   **32 bits for the data bus**.
        *   **32 bits for the addressing bus**, allowing access to a lot more memory than previous consoles.
    *   **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Contains **one ALU**, responsible for arithmetic (addition, subtraction) and logical operations (bitwise OR, AND).

*   **Co-processors and Special Units (within the CPU chip)**
    *   **CP0 (Co-processor 0)**: The **System Control** co-processor, managing internal functions like cache implementation, interrupts, and exceptions.
    *   **CP2 (Co-processor 2) / GTE (Geometry Transformation Engine)**: A **dedicated co-processor** that performs **3D math**, including matrix mathematics and 3D transformations, much faster than the CPU alone.
    *   **MDEC (Motion Decoder)**: A unit for **full-motion video (FMV) media decoding**.

*   **Pipeline**
    *   Features a **five-stage pipeline**.
    *   This pipeline allows for optimization and parallelization, enabling several operations (like fetching, decoding, executing) to occur in fewer clock cycles, thereby improving processor speed.
    *   Programmers need to be careful with the order of operations when using the pipeline due to how instructions are fetched, decoded, executed, and values stored.

*   **Programming Context**
    *   As programmers, the CPU is the component that is directly programmed and orchestrates everything.
    *   The source emphasizes that understanding these components (registers, ALU, buses, pipeline) will become clearer through practical programming.
