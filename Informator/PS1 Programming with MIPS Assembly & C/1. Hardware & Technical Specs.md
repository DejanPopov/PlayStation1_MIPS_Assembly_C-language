*   **Development & Origin**
    *   The PlayStation's development involved a relationship between Sony and Nintendo at its start.
    *   **Ken Kutaragi** was the manager of the engineering team and is known as the "father of the PlayStation".
    *   The notes focus on the **original PlayStation model** as it was released in 1994.

*   **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**
    *   The PlayStation uses a **32-bit MIPS CPU**.
    *   LSI Logic was the semiconductor manufacturer that supplied this CPU solution.
    *   It runs at a frequency of **33.86 MHz**.
    *   As programmers, the CPU is the component that is directly programmed and orchestrates everything.
    *   The CPU chip also includes co-processors and the MDEC unit, making it akin to a "system on a chip".

*   **Memory**
    *   **RAM**: The console has **2 megabytes of EDO memory**, comprised of four chips (each 512KB). This RAM is used for storing and fetching values and declaring variables. RAM is memory-mapped, allowing the CPU direct access.
    *   **Video RAM (VRAM)**: There is **1 megabyte of Video RAM**, made up of two 512KB chips located next to the GPU. VRAM is used to store textures, the actual frame buffer (for displaying on screen, including double buffering), images, and fonts. The CPU **does not have direct access** to VRAM; communication occurs via the GPU.
    *   **Sound RAM**: There is **512 kilobytes of DRAM** dedicated for sound, located near the SPU chip.

*   **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)**
    *   A dedicated GPU chip is responsible for **rasterization**.
    *   The GPU transforms instructions (e.g., triangle information) into pixel values and colours for display on screen.
    *   It is described as a **2D rasterization GPU**, meaning it knows how to render 2D triangles or 2D quads, including solid colour and Gouraud shading triangles.
    *   All **3D mathematics** (e.g., transformations) must be performed *before* sending values to the GPU.
    *   The GPU is responsible for populating the frame buffer in VRAM when rasterizing.

*   **Co-processors & Special Units**
    *   MIPS CPUs often include co-processors to assist the main CPU.
    *   **CP0 (Co-processor 0)**: This is the **System Control** co-processor. It manages internal functions like handling cache values (instruction cache), interrupts, and exceptions.
    *   **CP2 (Co-processor 2) / GTE**: This is the **Geometry Transformation Engine**. Its primary role is to perform **geometry transformation**, including vector math, matrix math, rotation, projection, and translation, significantly faster than the CPU alone.
    *   **MDEC (Motion Decoder)**: This is a special unit that helps achieve full-motion videos (FMVs) often seen before games. It is located within the same chip as the CPU and co-processors.
    *   **CP1**: In typical MIPS processors, CP1 is dedicated to floating-point units. However, **Sony did not include a floating-point co-processor**, leading to the use of **fixed-point mathematics** in PlayStation development.

*   **Sound Processing Unit (SPU)**
    *   The PlayStation has a dedicated **SPU (Sound Processing Unit)**.
    *   It is a **16-bit** unit with **24 ADPCM channels**.
    *   It is a proprietary audio chip developed by Sony.

*   **CD-ROM Subsystem**
    *   Given the use of CD-ROMs as the primary media for data and program instructions, there's a dedicated CD-ROM subsystem.
    *   This includes a **CD-ROM DSP chip** and a **CD-ROM controller** responsible for managing the motor and laser.

*   **External Connections & Peripherals**
    *   The motherboard includes various external ports on the top right: a **parallel port**, a **serial port**, **RCA out**, **composite out**, and **AV multi out** connections for connecting to a TV set.
    *   Connections for controllers are located at the bottom of the board.

*   **Programming Considerations**
    *   Programmers directly instruct the CPU, which then sends values to the GPU, SPU, and other components.
    *   Components like RAM are **memory-mapped**, allowing the CPU direct access.
    *   However, components like **VRAM are not directly memory-mapped**, so the CPU interacts with them indirectly through other units (e.g., the GPU for VRAM).
