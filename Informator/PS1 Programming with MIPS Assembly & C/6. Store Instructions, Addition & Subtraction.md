### Store Instructions

- **Purpose**: To store **values from CPU registers into specific memory addresses**. This is the reverse operation of load instructions.
- **Types of Store Instructions (by size)**:
    - **`sw` (store word)**:
        - Stores an **entire 32-bit word** from a register into a memory address.
        - **Example**: `sw T1, 0x1810(T0)`.
            - This example shows storing the contents of register `T1` (a 32-bit word) into a memory address.
            - The memory address is calculated by adding the value in `T0` (which was previously loaded with `0x1F800000` using `lui T0, 0x1F80`) to the offset `0x1810`.
            - The resulting address, `0x1F801810`, is identified as the **GP0 register of the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**.
            - Storing a word to `GP0` is described as **sending information to that GPU register**, effectively sending a command or data packet for rendering.
    - **`sh` (store half-word)**:
        - Stores **16 bits (half a word)** from a register into a memory address.
        - Example demonstrates storing a 16-bit value into the same `0x1F801810` address as `sw`, but only 16 bits are stored.
    - **`sb` (store byte)**:
        - Stores **1 byte (8 bits)** from a register into a memory address.
        - Example demonstrates storing a single byte into the `0x1F801810` address.
- **Key Concept**: Memory addresses can be calculated using an **offset (immediate value)** added to a **base address (value in a register)**.

### Arithmetic and Computational Instructions

- The CPU can perform **mathematical operations** like addition and subtraction directly on values in registers.
- **Source and Destination**: For these operations, it's crucial to remember which register holds the **final result (destination)** and which registers provide the **input values (sources)**.

#### Addition Instructions

- **`add` (add registers)**:
    - **Purpose**: Adds the values of **two source registers** and stores the sum in a **destination register**.
    - **Syntax Example**: `add T0, T1, T2`.
    - **Interpretation**: This is equivalent to `T0 = T1 + T2`.
    - **Signed Operation**: This is a **signed addition**, meaning it respects positive and negative values.
- **`addi` (add immediate)**:
    - **Purpose**: Adds a **constant number (immediate value)** to the value of a source register and stores the result in a destination register.
    - **Syntax Example**: `addi T0, T1, 5`.
    - **Interpretation**: This is equivalent to `T0 = T1 + 5`.
    - **No `subi` (subtract immediate)**: There is **no dedicated `subi` instruction** for immediate subtraction. Instead, you perform subtraction by using `addi` with a **negative immediate number** (e.g., `addi S0, S1, -5` is equivalent to `S0 = S1 - 5`).
- **`addu` (add unsigned)**:
    - **Purpose**: Performs an **unsigned addition** of two registers.
    - **Syntax Example**: `addu S0, S1, S2`.
    - **Signed vs. Unsigned**: It does not consider the potential for numbers to be negative; it treats all values as positive.
- **`addiu` (add immediate unsigned)**:
    - **Purpose**: Performs an **unsigned addition** between a register and a constant number.
    - **Syntax**: Similar to `addi`, but unsigned.

#### Subtraction Instructions

- **`sub` (subtract registers)**:
    
    - **Purpose**: Subtracts the value of one source register from another and stores the difference in a destination register.
    - **Syntax Example**: `sub A0, A0, A2`.
    - **Interpretation**: This is equivalent to `A0 = A0 - A2`.
    - **Signed Operation**: This is a **signed subtraction**.
- **Note**: Multiplication and division instructions are not covered in this source and are mentioned as special cases that will be discussed later.
