*   **Memory Fundamentals for the MIPS CPU**
    *   For the CPU to perform useful operations, it must be able to **access RAM** and communicate with other components like the **GPU, SPU, CD controller, and MDEC**.
    *   These other components are **memory-mapped**, meaning they occupy specific addresses within the overall memory space.
    *   Memory is conceptualized as a **one-dimensional array of addressable values**.
    *   Each memory address on the MIPS CPU stores **one byte** (8 bits) of data.
    *   Each memory address itself is **32 bits** long (e.g., `0x00000000` to `0xFFFFFFFF`).
    *   The **address bus is 32 bits**, which means the CPU can address a total of **2 to the power of 32 addressable bytes**. This total memory space includes not only RAM but also memory-mapped hardware components.

*   **Physical vs. Virtual Memory**
    *   The PlayStation hardware **does not have a Memory Management Unit (MMU)**.
    *   Consequently, it **does not utilize virtual memory**.
    *   All memory addresses used and discussed are **physical memory addresses**, directly corresponding to the hardware's actual layout.
    *   This simplifies programming as there is no abstraction layer for memory. While some more advanced MIPS CPUs do have MMUs and virtual memory, the PlayStation's CPU does not.

*   **Byte Ordering (Endianness)**
    *   **Endianness** refers to the order in which bytes of a multi-byte value are stored in memory or on media. Different CPUs use different orders.
    *   **Big-Endian**: The **most significant byte comes first**, followed by the least significant byte. For example, the hexadecimal number `0x12345678` would be stored as `12 34 56 78`. CPUs like the Motorola 68000 use big-endian.
    *   **Little-Endian**: The **least significant byte comes first** (placed in the lowest memory address), followed by the more significant bytes. For the same hexadecimal number `0x12345678`, it would be stored as **`78 56 34 12`**.
    *   The **R300A MIPS CPU of the PlayStation uses little-endian** byte ordering.
    *   Although MIPS CPUs can theoretically support either endianness, the PlayStation's CPU is **hardwired to be a little-endian processor**.
    *   This is an important consideration for programmers, as when inspecting memory dumps with an emulator or debugger, data will appear in the **reverse order** compared to what human intuition might expect for multi-byte values.
